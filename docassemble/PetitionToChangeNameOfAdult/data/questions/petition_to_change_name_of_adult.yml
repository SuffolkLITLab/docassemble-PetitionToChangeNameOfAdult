question: |
  Changing your name on official documents
subquestion: |
  You can use this form to change your name if you are over the age of
  18 and live in Massachusetts. This form is called a petition.
  
  To file your petition, you will also need:
  
  * A certified copy of your birth certificate. You can get this from your city hall.
  * A Court Activity Record Information (CARI) authorization form. We will help you fill in the CARI form.
  * A copy of any certified documents showing your **past** name changes. If you have never changed your name before you do not need this.
  
  There is a fee for requesting a name change. If you cannot afford the fee,
  you will not be charged. We will help you request a fee waiver if you are
  eligible.
  
  You will need to get this document notarized before you file it.
