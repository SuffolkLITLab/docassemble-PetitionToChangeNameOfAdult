question: |
  Publication of your new name
subquestion: |
  If the judge grants your petition, you may need to "publish" your new
  name in a local newspaper.
  
  If publishing your name is not safe or you have another good reason not to
  publish your name, you can ask the judge to "waive" publication.

  - Do you need the judge to waive publication?: ask_waiver_of_publication

    What should I say?
  content: |
    Use your own words to explain to the judge **why** you cannot publish your
    name. Include specific facts.
    
    For example, you may not be able to publish your name because:
    
    * Publishing your name change would not be safe.
    * Publishing your name change would expose you to stalking, harassment or 
      physical harm.
    * Publishing your name change would cause harm in some other way, including
      financial harm or risk.

    Explain to the judge the reason that applies to you. Not being able to afford
    the publication is usually not a reason. If you cannot afford to publish your 
    name, the court may pay for the publication.
